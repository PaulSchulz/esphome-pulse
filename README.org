* Repository

- GitHub: https://github.com/PaulSchulz/esphome-pulse
- Clone: ~git clone git@github.com:PaulSchulz/esphome-pulse.git~

* Software
** Common YAML files
The firmware makes use of a master file, with a collection of shared YAML files
in 'common/'.

** Using the secrets.html
A dummy 'secrets' file has been included in the repository. Edit it to match
your Wifi and Hom Assistant API credentials.

Please do not include this file in any pull requests.

To ensure this, include the following alias in your .git/config file

#+begin_example
[alias]
    ignore = update-index --assume-unchanged
    unignore = update-index --no-assume-unchanged
    ignored = !git ls-files -v | grep "^[[:lower:]]"
#+end_example

and then set changes to this file to be ignored by git in future commits on the
CLI with:

#+begin_src sh
$ git ignore esphome/secrets.yaml
$ git ignored
h esphome/secrets.yaml
#+end_src

Multiple alternative local secrets files in 'esphome/' can stored by using
filenames of the form 'secrets-ID.yaml'. These are set to be ignored in
'.gitignore', and can be copied to override 'secrets.yaml' as required.
